## Description

*cozy-vcard* is a simple library to deal with the vcard format. It makes life
easier to parse vcard files.

## Usage

```javascript
# Import

var vcf = fs.readFileSync('test/friend.vcf', 'utf8');
var vparser = new VCardParser(vcf);
var vcontact = parser.components[0];
var vsomeprop = contact.properties[0]:
// vcontact.org == 'SuperCorp'
// someprop.value == '+33123456789'
// someprop.name == 'tel'
// someprop.type == 'home'
// someprop.pref == true


# Export
var vcfString = VCardParser.toVCF(vcontact);
var vcf = fs.writeFileSync('test/friend-export.vcf', vcfString, 'utf8');
```

## Format

This vCard importer doesn't try to follow the official RFC. It is just made to
handle properly vCards from major vendors: Google, Android, iOS, OSX and
thunderbird.

The vCard exporter follow the Google way to write vcards. It can take an option
to export the data to Android format or iOS format

#### How data are handled in memory

Data are stored as direct fields when vendors provide them that way. If not
they are handled as "datapoints". One data datapoint has three fields:

* `name`: the category of the data
* `type`: the label of the field
* `value`: the value of the field


## TODO

If you want to contribute, here is a non-exhaustive list of things to do to
make this project perfect!

Export: 

* manage properly the `pref` attribute.
* manage properly custom types (currently they are often exported uppercased).

Tests: 

* Make full tests field values totally agnostic. 
* Test all fields of full vCards during import and export.

Handle other vendors:

* Thunderbird plugins
* Outlook
* FullContact
